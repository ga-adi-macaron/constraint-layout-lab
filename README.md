# Constraint Layout Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

#### Create constraint layouts

It's time to test your skills with constraint layouts. You will choose screenshots from three apps of your choice, and recreate them using constraint layouts. You don't need to include drawables from the screenshots, just use ImageViews with a solid background color in their place.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create constraint layouts to mimic three screenshots of your choice
- Include three screenshots you chose


#### Deliverable

An app with at least three activities containing three constraint layouts. Include the three screenshots you chose somewhere in the repo for comparison to your final product.
